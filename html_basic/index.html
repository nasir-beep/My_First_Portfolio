    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio Journey!</h1>

    <p>This is the very first step in building my online portfolio. Learning how to structure a webpage using basic HTML tags is foundational. Every great project starts with a single document, and this index.html file is that essential beginning.</p>

    <h2>The Essential Page Structure</h2>

    <p>A typical HTML document is divided into two main sections: the head and the body. The **head** contains metadata, like the title you see in the browser tab, and links to external resources. The **body**, on the other hand, contains all the visible content—the text, images, links, and everything else the user interacts with.</p>

    <h3>Headings and Paragraphs for Organization</h3>

    <p>Headings are crucial for organizing content and improving accessibility. We use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the most important title, and then descend through <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, and so on, to create a clean, logical hierarchy. Paragraphs (using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag) are used for standard text blocks, ensuring readable separation between distinct ideas.</p>

    <p>The goal is to master these fundamental building blocks and eventually combine them with CSS for advanced styling and JavaScript for interactive features. This simple file represents a huge leap in web development understanding and serves as the foundation for future work.</p>
